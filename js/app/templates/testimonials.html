				NannyTracker.com's automated faq response states "We'll get back to you in 24 hours" and guess what, they absolutely DO! I had a issue on the site and NannyTracker.com went above and beyond in helping solve the issue with some great suggestions. She continued to get back to me to ensure I was happy with the outcome. I WAS!
